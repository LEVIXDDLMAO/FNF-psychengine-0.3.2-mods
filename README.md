# This repo is now deprecated though will still get updates whenever I feel like it, those updates will probably be only finishing stuff and fixing issues to get somehow of a finished project or something new repo its using [latest commit](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/commit/afdfcad8b2423774dba165cfb5248de0017123cf) of Psych Engine which its based off 0.5b Pre-Release, using commits because ShadowMario pushed some commits to fix HTML5 so that's it I guess.
## Thanks to everyone who saw this code :D
